## How It Works

### Full Audit Flow

When you run `/geo audit https://example.com`:

1. **Discovery** — Fetches homepage, detects business type, crawls sitemap
2. **Parallel Analysis** — Launches 5 subagents simultaneously:
   - AI Visibility (citability, crawlers, llms.txt, brand mentions)
   - Platform Analysis (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AIO readiness)
   - Technical SEO (Core Web Vitals, SSR, security, mobile)
   - Content Quality (E-E-A-T, readability, freshness)
   - Schema Markup (detection, validation, generation)
3. **Synthesis** — Aggregates scores, generates composite GEO Score (0-100)
4. **Report** — Outputs prioritized action plan with quick wins

### Scoring Methodology

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| AI Citability & Visibility | 25% |
| Brand Authority Signals | 20% |
| Content Quality & E-E-A-T | 20% |
| Technical Foundations | 15% |
| Structured Data | 10% |
| Platform Optimization | 10% |

## Key Features

### Citability Scoring
Analyzes content blocks for AI citation readiness. Optimal AI-cited passages are 134-167 words, self-contained, fact-rich, and directly answer questions.

### AI Crawler Analysis
Checks robots.txt for 14+ AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, etc.) and provides specific allow/block recommendations.

### Brand Mention Scanning
Brand mentions correlate 3x more strongly with AI visibility than backlinks. Scans YouTube, Reddit, Wikipedia, LinkedIn, and 7+ other platforms.

### Platform-Specific Optimization
Only 11% of domains are cited by both ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query. Provides tailored recommendations per platform.

### llms.txt Generation
Generates the emerging llms.txt standard file that helps AI crawlers understand your site structure.

### Client-Ready Reports
Generates professional GEO reports in markdown or PDF format. PDF reports include score gauges, bar charts, platform readiness visualizations, color-coded tables, and prioritized action plans — ready to deliver to clients.
