## Orchestration Logic

### Full Audit (`/geo audit <url>`)

**Phase 1: Discovery (Sequential)**
1. Fetch homepage HTML (curl or WebFetch)
2. Detect business type (SaaS, Local, E-commerce, Publisher, Agency, Other)
3. Extract key pages from sitemap.xml or internal links (up to 50 pages)

**Phase 2: Parallel Analysis (Delegate to Subagents)**
Launch these 5 subagents simultaneously:

| Subagent | File | Responsibility |
|----------|------|---------------|
| geo-ai-visibility | `agents/geo-ai-visibility.md` | GEO audit, citability, AI crawlers, llms.txt, brand mentions |
| geo-platform-analysis | `agents/geo-platform-analysis.md` | Platform-specific optimization (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AIO) |
| geo-technical | `agents/geo-technical.md` | Technical SEO, Core Web Vitals, crawlability, indexability |
| geo-content | `agents/geo-content.md` | Content quality, E-E-A-T, readability, AI content detection |
| geo-schema | `agents/geo-schema.md` | Schema markup detection, validation, generation |

**Phase 3: Synthesis (Sequential)**
1. Collect all subagent reports
2. Calculate composite GEO Score (0-100)
3. Generate prioritized action plan
4. Output client-ready report

### Scoring Methodology

| Category | Weight | Measured By |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| AI Citability & Visibility | 25% | Passage scoring, answer block quality, AI crawler access |
| Brand Authority Signals | 20% | Mentions on Reddit, YouTube, Wikipedia, LinkedIn; entity presence |
| Content Quality & E-E-A-T | 20% | Expertise signals, original data, author credentials |
| Technical Foundations | 15% | SSR, Core Web Vitals, crawlability, mobile, security |
| Structured Data | 10% | Schema completeness, JSON-LD validation, rich result eligibility |
| Platform Optimization | 10% | Platform-specific readiness (Google AIO, ChatGPT, Perplexity) |

---

## Business Type Detection

Analyze homepage for patterns:

| Type | Signals |
|------|---------|
| **SaaS** | Pricing page, "Sign up", "Free trial", "/app", "/dashboard", API docs |
| **Local Service** | Phone number, address, "Near me", Google Maps embed, service area |
| **E-commerce** | Product pages, cart, "Add to cart", price elements, product schema |
| **Publisher** | Blog, articles, bylines, publication dates, article schema |
| **Agency** | Portfolio, case studies, "Our services", client logos, testimonials |
| **Other** | Default — apply general GEO best practices |

Adjust recommendations based on detected type. Local businesses need LocalBusiness schema and Google Business Profile optimization. SaaS needs SoftwareApplication schema and comparison page strategy. E-commerce needs Product schema and review aggregation.

## PDF Report Generation

The `/geo report-pdf <url>` command generates a professional, branded PDF report:

### How It Works
1. Run the full audit or individual analyses first
2. Collect all scores and findings into a JSON structure
3. Execute the PDF generator: `python3 ~/.claude/skills/geo/scripts/generate_pdf_report.py data.json GEO-REPORT.pdf`

### What the PDF Includes
- **Cover page** with GEO score gauge visualization
- **Score breakdown** with color-coded bar charts
- **AI Platform Readiness** dashboard with horizontal bar chart
- **Crawler Access** status table with color-coded Allow/Block
- **Key Findings** categorized by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Prioritized Action Plan** (Quick Wins, Medium-Term, Strategic)
- **Methodology & Glossary** appendix

### Workflow
1. First run `/geo audit <url>` to collect all data
2. Then run `/geo report-pdf <url>` to generate the PDF
3. The tool will compile audit data into JSON, then generate the PDF
4. Output: `GEO-REPORT.pdf` in the current directory

## Quality Gates

- **Crawl limit:** Max 50 pages per audit (focus on quality over quantity)
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds per page fetch
- **Rate limiting:** 1-second delay between requests, max 5 concurrent
- **Robots.txt:** Always respect, always check
- **Duplicate detection:** Skip pages with >80% content similarity
